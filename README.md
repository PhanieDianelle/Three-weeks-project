Abstract

The realm of computer-aided diagnosis holds immense promise in addressing
pressing public health concerns, such as the weighty burden posed by skin cancer.
A pivotal stride toward this noble objective involves the segmentation of skin
lesions from images. Yet, the intricacy of this task is amplified when dealing
with low-quality images, often tainted by noise, artifacts, and diminished resolution—
deterrents that challenge conventional segmentation algorithms. The crux of
our proposed project rests in the creation of an unyielding skin lesion segmentation
system, adept at impeccably demarcating skin lesions within the confines of
suboptimal images. Through the adept utilization of sophisticated deep learning
techniques, combined with enhancement techniques, our endeavor endeavors to
uplift the performance of skin lesion segmentation in the realm of low-quality
images. This augmentation is poised to play a pivotal role in facilitating early
skin cancer diagnosis, and by extension, empower dermatologists to make wellinformed
decisions with augmented precision. We’ve embarked on the development
of four distinct machine learning models—LinkNet, UNET, ConvMixer, and Mask
RCNN—as potent tools for achieving this nuanced segmentation task. To underpin
our efforts, we’ve harnessed the comprehensive dataset from isic2018-challengetask1-
data-segmentation. This robust foundation serves as the cornerstone for our
evaluation process, characterized by a quartet of rigorous metrics: Dice coefficient,
Jaccard index, Intersection over Union (IoU), and the F1 score. Our dedication to
meticulous evaluation mirrors our commitment to delivering impactful outcomes
that align with the highest standards of accuracy and efficacy.
